# Unity-Pathways

This repository includes playable builds for my implementation of Prototypes and Challenges 1-5 of the Unity Pathway Junior Programmer.

To run:

Download a .zip file and extract the contents. Open the `Build` folder and open the respective Unity Application file.

### Prototypes

Prototypes are the main projects that taught how to develop certain aspects of games. My implementation also includes the Bonus Features provided by the Pathway program.

* **Driving Simulator** - Local multiplayer driving simulation where you can control two tanks and drive down a road with obstacles

* **Food Stampede** - Shoot food at an oncoming stampede of animals

* **Parkour** - An infinite run and jump game
  * Press `Space` to jump, double tap to Double Jump
  * Hold `LeftShift` to run faster
  

* **Sumo Battle** - Knock off enemy waves from the battle ring using brute force and power-ups
  * Power-ups will periodically spawn on the arena. There are three different power-ups:
    * Rockets - Green Diamond
      * Press `F` to shoot rockets at enemies
    * Pushback - Yellow Diamond
      * Increases force you hit enemies with
    * Smash - Brown Diamond
      * Press `Space` to rise and smash the ground, knocking back enemies in the area
  * Every 2 rounds, a boss will spawn that repeatedly spawns enemies until it is taken out

* **Fruit Ninja** - Slice the fruit, avoid the bombs

### Challenges

Challenges are meant to practice the skills learned from their respective Prototypes in a brand new scene. You are required to fix the bugs within the game
using your knowledge of C# scripting and Unity.

* **Plane Simulator** - Fly a plane through some obstacles

* **Fetch** - Send out your dog to catch the balls dropping from the sky

* **Balloon Bomb** - As a balloon, avoid the bombs and collect money

* **Soccer** - Knock the oncoming soccer balls into the other goal while defending your own goal

* **Whack-a-Food** - Click the food and avoid the skulls to earn points
